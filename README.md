A project for my wife 🤨


When I talk to juniors about Domain Driven Design, it is being a little bit confusing. Because unless understanding what is complexity in a software development and how to deal with it, new software developers tend to feel DDD itself is unnecessarly complex. To express new software developers what DDD has to offer, it is a must to introduce a little bit complex problem to solve while talking about DDD.

In a similar fashion, most of the design patterns are not easy to grab unless hitting the right problem while writing code. 

So, I use this repository as an example when I talk about DDD concepts and some of the design patterns. For sampling things, I use a generic real world problem to get the listeners understand the domain easily. The problem that this project trying to solve is "Manage your own house!". To add domain complexity, I include things like "cooking recipes" and "calculations of required food amounts to stay fit".
